Most vehicles on Earth use some form of combustion for energy, historically burning fossil fuels including coal, petrol and diesel using oxygen from the air. In Martian year 1950 fusion technology has been developed providing plentiful electrical energy; this allows easy electrolysis to produce hydrogen and the favoured current energy source for vehicles on Earth is hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cells essentially work by burning hydrogen in a controlled way, using oxygen and making water and electricity and byproducts. With these technologies oxygen is just as important as the fuel (either fossil fuel or hydrogen), but it can be grabbed straight from the air. This is great because essentially half of the 'fuel' the vehicle needs doesn't need to be carried by the vehicle.

On Mars the atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide and nitrogen. This suddenly makes burning something much more difficult as the vehicle has to carry the oxidiser (typically oxygen) as well as the fuel. Mars also has no fossil fuel reserves (there was never any life to make them), although biomass left over from food production can be used.
